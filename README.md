# Heart-Disease-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning

* This Machine learning project focuses on predicting whether or not a patient is suffering from Heart disease or not,where 1 indicates that the patient is suffering from Heart disease and 0 means the patient is not suffering from such disease the data is gotten from kaggle datasets.

* The data contains the health and heart conditions of different hospital patients and the task here was to build a machine learning model to predict whether or not a patient is suffering from a heart disease.

We avoided cleaning the data(removing outliers and likes) in order to not lose valuable information in the data.

* The model was trained on 3 different Machine learning algorithms and the aim was to get an accuracy of 90% but it was not achievable ,although the accuracy was close with 88%. The logistic regression model performed best.

* A number of evaluation metrics ,confusion matrix,for instance.
* The code file is very well detailed.
