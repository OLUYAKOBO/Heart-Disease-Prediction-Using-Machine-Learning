# Heart-Disease-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning

This Machine learning project focuses on predicting whether or not a patient is suffering from Heart disease or not ,where 1 indicates that the patient is suffering from Heart disease and 0 means the patient is not suffering from such disease the data is gotten from kaggle datasets.
The data contains the health and heart conditions of different hospital patients and my task here was to build a machine learning model to predict whether or not a patient is suffering from a heart disease.
I avoided cleaning the data(removing outliers and likes) in order to not lose valuable information in the data.
I trained the model on 3 different Machine learning algorithms and my aim was to get an accuracy of 90% but i was not able to achieve that ,although i was close with 88%. The logistic regression model performed best.
I used a number of evaluation metrics ,confusion matrix,for instance.
The code file is very well detailed.
